Yay!! Thank you for taking the time to contribute and to take a look at this guide!
No contribution is too big or small, so thank you for helping our community!
The better we follow standards in this document, the faster we can put your contribution
to good use.

## Issues
This may change as the role of issues change, but for the time being:

* Include a thorough description of your issue, including any details relevant to the
  machine you're on, i.e. your OS and your version of Node.
* Include any error messages.
* Provide a brief description on how to replicate your particular problem.
* If you are already aware of the underlying issue, please place that information inside
  the issue as well.

## Pull Requests

* Include any issues relevant to your PR, otherwise remove the "Issues" section.
* Include a bulleted list of changes under the "Changes" section.
  * Use imperative mood when describing these, i.e. "Create new config" or "Update user
    route handler"
  * Be short, yet descriptive.
  * Be thorough. This is particularly important because all of these changes
    will be used as the commit body for your PR.
* Include a gif. It can be relevant, weird, funny, or whatever you like. This isn't
  strictly necessary, but one may be added for you if you don't do it yourself.. :smile:
* Include an applicable label from each label section. These help us organize our PRs and make
  it easier to find them later.
* Tag a few reviewers. Ideally, we would like two reviews per PR before we merge, but exceptions
  may be made.

Lastly, don't be a dick. Take a look at our [Code of Conduct][codeofconduct]
if you don't understand what that means. It would be unfortunate to
actually have to enforce it. :smile:
