# Ubiquitous Language

### User
A member of the Monarch community.
Users can request a sidekick and remove a sidekick.

*Rationale* - Terrible, but clear for now.


### Sidekick
A designated user that supports another user through conversations.
A sidekick is meant to provide advice, resource information, and moral support to another user.
Users are ideally paired with a sidekick within 50 miles. If there are no sidekicks within 50 miles,
then sidekicks within 100 miles is good and beyond 100 miles is acceptable.
Sidekicks are manually vetted initially.

*Rationale* - Has no power connotations. Evokes silly, but also a bit of badass.


### Conversation
A dialog opened between two users that facilitates the sending
and receiving of messages.


### Message
An individual statement sent from one user to another user.


### Notification
An email, push notification, or something similar that is sent to a user
to notify them of a pending sidekick request or something similar. This
also includes sign-up confirmation.


### Connect
The process of finding resources (Sidekicks, maybe support groups) for users
and providing a means to request access to those resources.


### Complaint
A message sent to Monarch by a user or a sidekick flagging another user or sidekick
for behavior that violates the code of conduct.

When a user receives a complaint, they are immediately banned,
but given an appeals process for wrongful banning.

After initial rollout, when a sidekick receives a complaint, their complaint will
be reviewed by three other sidekicks to determine action.
